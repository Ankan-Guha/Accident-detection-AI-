# Accident-detection-AI-

Engineered an accident detection model using YOLOv8 with 67% accuracy and real-time
inference at 14 FPS.Trained on 10,000+ annotated images, reducing false positives by 28%
through iterative optimization.  Build a front end website for showcasing the result from API using HTML, CSS, and JS.  Processed live traffic footage with OpenCV and triggered emergency alerts via Flask API
within 3 seconds of detection.  Reduced emergency response time by up to 40%, potentially saving 1 in every 3 critical accident
victims, based on WHO data.
